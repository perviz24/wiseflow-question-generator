Photosynthesis Test Content

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. It occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells.

The light-dependent reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes. Water molecules are split, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This process creates ATP and NADPH.

The Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions) occurs in the stroma. Carbon dioxide is fixed into organic molecules using the ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions.

The overall equation for photosynthesis is:
6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2

Key terms:
- Chlorophyll: The green pigment that captures light energy
- Stomata: Pores that allow gas exchange
- Glucose: The sugar molecule produced as the end product
